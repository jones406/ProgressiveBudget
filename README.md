# About the App
Added functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality:
- add expenses and deposits to your budget with or without a connection
- after entering transactions offline, total updates when brought back online.

# User Story

AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
```

# Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
```
